# Go Support Local is a Simple Web Site (SWS)

My simple website is under construction and in the works....

I am creating a collection of information about AWS Architecture and the resources used to build microservices base applications. This includes some of the applications from the most important business units that I have encountered in my 25 years in the IT Industry. I have been involved in many software projects, both in the commercial and military sectors regarding mission critical applications.

I am using this SWS layout for now because I am considering several responsive architectures like SPA, PWA, and RIA. However, I have settled on Angular/Ionic/Nodejs on the front end, but the back end is under consideration. I would like to have notification services, like email, SMS, MMS, and voice to engage people with interests that would benefit from my Solution Architecture offerings.

In addition, I hope to add Elastic Search capabilities and other features to allow me to create and select Custom Solution Architectures for others requiring Cloud resources with a focus on cost-effective approaches.

Thank you for your interest.

## Amazon Web Services (AWS) sponsored AWSome Day in Dallas

The AWSome day provides an extensive overview of the AWS IaaS platform. AWS is a very large platform and continues to grow every year in new directions in managed services and enhanced resources.
I have a desire to continue my efforts with SWS to promote this shared knowledge among my peers.
